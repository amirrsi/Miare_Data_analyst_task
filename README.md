This project tackles a data-driven challenge designed to test the skills relevant to **Planning Data Analyst** roles.

The project is divided into four main parts:

- **Part 1**: SQL Querying  
- **Part 2**: Data Visualization  
- **Part 3**: [Add your title]  
- **Part 4**: [Add your title]

## Part 1: SQL Querying
In this part I used Sqlite 3 in python to extract data From Given Database and the Code is avaliable in **Miare_task.ipynb**

---

## Part 2: Data Visualization

In this part, I followed a structured approach to turn raw data into actionable business insights:

1. **Data Validity Check**:  
   Performed statistical validation to assess data qualityâ€”checking for missing values, outliers, and distribution patterns.

2. **Exploratory Visualizations**:  
   Created multiple chart types using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to explore user journeys, conversion funnels, and temporal trends.

3. **Final Selection & Rationale**:  
   Selected the most effective visualizations based on:
   - **Clarity**: Easy to interpret at a glance  
   - **Actionability**: Directly supports business decisions (e.g., identifying funnel drop-offs)  
   - **Accuracy**: Faithfully represents underlying data  

The final visuals highlight key patterns that inform strategic planning and optimization opportunities.

## Part 3: Retention & Root Cause Analysis
In this part I used Python to extract the data from database and it can be found where in the Retention and Root Cause analysis part in Miare_task.ipynb file
I Used Query to find the related data for each 28 of orders database

I used trend analysis to find the root Cause
approach: I used Driver Data to see if the Driver Count of the dropped city Decreased significantly and why that happend


---

## Part 4: 
-According to Expired orders data In **esfahan** there is a Coverage or price related Supply gap that should be investigated and Promotion Given to Drivers or Acqusition needed.
- I also defined a KPI (O/D) which is the count of Completed Orders/ Active Drivers to see where is the Supply Gap Problem.
  For example; Mashhad O/D is lowe than the other cities and the neede Action is to improve the Completed Orders
