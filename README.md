## Part 2: Data Visualization

In this part, I followed a structured approach to turn raw data into actionable insights:

1. **Data Validity Check**:  
   Performed statistical validation to ensure data quality (e.g., missing values, outliers, distributions).

2. **Exploratory Visualizations**:  
   Created multiple chart types in Python (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly) to explore trends, funnels, and user behavior.

3. **Final Selection & Rationale**:  
   Selected the most effective visualizations based on:
   - Clarity and simplicity  
   - Relevance to business decisions  
   - Faithful representation of data  

The chosen plots highlight key patterns—such as drop-off points in conversion funnels and time-based trends—to support data-driven planning.
