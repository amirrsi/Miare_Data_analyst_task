# Miare_Data_analyst_task

This project tackles a data-driven challenge designed to test the skills relevant to **Planning Data Analyst** roles.

The project is divided into four main parts:

- **Part 1**: SQL Querying  
- **Part 2**: Data Visualization  
- **Part 3**: [Add your title]  
- **Part 4**: [Add your title]

## Part 1: SQL Querying

[Write a short description of your SQL tasks here â€” e.g., "Wrote queries to extract user behavior, calculate conversion rates, and segment customers based on activity."]

## Part 2: Data Visualization

In this part, I followed a structured approach to turn raw data into actionable business insights:

1. **Data Validity Check**:  
   Performed statistical validation to assess data qualityâ€”checking for missing values, outliers, and distribution patterns.

2. **Exploratory Visualizations**:  
   Created multiple chart types using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to explore user journeys, conversion funnels, and temporal trends.

3. **Final Selection & Rationale**:  
   Selected the most effective visualizations based on:
   - **Clarity**: Easy to interpret at a glance  
   - **Actionability**: Directly supports business decisions (e.g., identifying funnel drop-offs)  
   - **Accuracy**: Faithfully represents underlying data  

The final visuals highlight key patterns that inform strategic planning and optimization opportunities.
